# How k-NN algorithm works

In human terms, the algorithm works as "You will become like the people you associate with". Simply said you have some dataset, each datapoint and the datapoint M you want to classify has an x and y value (in 2D space), then you calculate distances from datapoint M to other datapoints in dataset with euclidean distance, that is distance = √(x2 - x1)²+(y2 - y1)² where x2, y2 are position for dataset point and x1, y1 is for datapoint M.
